# Fyplab  
**Predict Virality Before It Happens**

Fyplab is a prediction-driven video platform where users forecast which videos will go viral.  
Instead of passive scrolling, Fyplab turns trend-spotting into an interactive experience—rewarding accuracy, timing, and insight.

### What Makes Fyplab Different
